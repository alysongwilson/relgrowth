  title : "A Practical Guide for Reliability Growth Analysts"
  content : "Reliability growth models are commonly used in the Department 
  of Defense (DoD) to plan, track, and project reliability during system acquisition 
  and testing. We describe the main classes of reliability growth models for 
  continuous failure time data and the metrics appropriate for their use. On this website, we provide 
  three different learning modalities from which we hope to advance the understanding of the development, implementation, 
  and use of reliability growth models across a sequence of DoD testing events."
