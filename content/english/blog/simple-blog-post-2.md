title: Reliability Growth

A reliability growth model describes how a system's reliability changes through a series of tests. As the test is conducted, the system might fail. If it does, the failure is analyzed to understand its cause and then it is fixed before testing resumes. This process is known as *test-analyze-fix-test* (TAFT).

Reliability growth models capture the changes in a system's reliability as it goes through the TAFT process. The models are used in three ways: to *plan* how a system's reliability will improve; to *track* the improvement (using data) through the tests; and to *project* whether the system is on-track to achieve its reliability goal.

Reliability growth planning curves provide guidance about what reliability may be expected during the testing process and a baseline to evaluate the success of reliability growth program. These curves are often developed by choosing parameters within a specific family of models. These curves can also support the determination of how much testing will be required to achieve a desired level of reliability, assuming a reasonable set of parameters are selected.

Reliability growth tracking curves provide estimates of current reliability by identifying the best fit of a model to data at any point in the test sequence. Reliability growth projection looks forward from the current data to estimate the reliability that might be anticipated given upcoming testing and corrective actions. These projections are used to forecast and address questions about, for example, whether a system will achieve its desired reliability.
